MacOS Defaults module
=====================

This is a fork of Ansible's osx_defaults module.
It allows users to read, write, and delete MacOS preferences from Ansible.
This fork is based on Etienne Desautels' fork, using Foundation/CoreFoundation.
It adds support for nested keys and values, and support for all types.
